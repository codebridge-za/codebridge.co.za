<h4>About the challenge</h4>
<p>South Africa is in the grip of the worst drought in a century. Farmers and citizens across the country are struggling to get access to enough water. Crops are failing, livestock are dying and entire communities do not have enough water to survive. The result is that food prices are skyrocketing due to dwindling supply of local produce and staples like maize and wheat are having to be imported at a huge cost.</p>

<p>Code for South Africa is working in partnership with the <a href="https://www.dwa.gov.za/default.aspx" target="_blank">Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS)</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/" target="_blank">Open Government Partnership (OGP)</a> to help address South Africa’s water shortages through the #Hack4Water challenge.</p>

<p>You are invited to submit a 30 second - 2 minute video in which you present your hack; it could be a big idea, solution, commercial product, community initiative, school project, home solution, inspiring water story, app or online tool, research paper, invention, awareness campaigns, a cool water-related song or dance or something we haven’t thought of.

<h4>Focus areas</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>How do we enable water source diversification</b> - how to shift the emphasis toward saving, local harvesting and ownership instead of waste reduction?
<li><b>How can we build more responsive, inclusive and accurate information and control systems</b>  through decentralized and open engagement within communities.
<li><b>What alternatives are there for water infrastructure development and associated financing models</b> - We need alternative water infrastructure financing and billing models including leveraging government grants with other funds, and decentralised financing/payment options.
<li><b>How do we support innovation and adoption of emerging technologies </b> - Coordinated effort to address technical issues around possible high-impact solutions and speed-up adoption of new technologies. Develop platforms and processes to manage risk and change perceptions of new technologies in engineering communities.
<li><b>How can we encourage change by big water users</b> (especially in agriculture)?
<li><b>How do we encourage water reuse through better partnerships (especially civil society)</b> - Change perceptions and implement novel solutions around water reuse.
<li><b>How to support innovation and manufacturing by small entrepreneurs along water value chain</b> - Identify opportunities for water innovation and collaboration with local government – by small businesses, citizens, local manufacturing, etc.
<li><b>How do we support inclusive community action and partnership (instead of just creating awareness about water use)</b> - Strong leadership enabling more diverse community forums, ownership and action around water.
<li><b>How do we support development of mid-level water careers</b> - transition from entry-level positions, visibility of job opportunities, mentoring and facilitate transfer of knowledge from retiring skills.

<h4>Previous #Hack4Water events</h4>
<p>The Department of Water and Sanitation is raising awareness of our country’s water and sanitation issues, exploring the problem space and digging into potential solutions by running a multi-event campaign.</p>

<p>At the beginning of March we hosted an unconference to ensure that the problem space was sufficiently understood and problems correctly framed. This event was aimed at bringing together representatives from government, industry, technology startups, civil society, academia, and the media to unpack the challenges faced by South Africans with regards to water and sanitation.</p>

<p>The outputs of the conference have been summarised into a number of focus areas. When thinking about your potential water solution, use these categories to help get some more direction.</p>

<p>The first weekend of April, we hosted <a href="/hack4water-hackathons.htm">Hack4Water hackathons</a> in Cape Town, Durban and Pretoria. The aim of these hackathons was to bring people together, come up with innovative solutions and ideas that can help solve South Africa's water problems, and transform these into submissions for the #Hack4Water challenge. You can find more information about these hackathons <a href="/hack4water-hackathons.htm">here</a>.</p>
